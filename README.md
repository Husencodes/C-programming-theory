#UNIT – I: Problem Solving and Introduction to C 
<br>
2 Marks Questions

##1.Define an algorithm.?
<br>
ANS:- An algorithm is step by step procedure desgine to perform a specific task or solve particular problem
EX:- Algorithm to add two numbers
1. Start
2. Read two numbers A and B
3. Add A and B and store in C
4. Display C
5. Stop

2.What are the characteristics of a good algorithm?
<br>
ANS:-
A good algorithm should have:
1. Clear and simple steps – no confusion in instructions.
2. Finite steps – it must finish after a limited number of steps.
3. Correct output – it should give the right result for all valid inputs.
4. Efficiency – it should use minimum time and memory.
<br>


3. What is a flowchart?
   <br>
A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm or process using symbols to show the flow of steps.
EX :- alogoritm same

4. Mention any two symbols used in flowcharts.
   <br>
• Oval → Start/Stop<br>
• Parallelogram → Input/Output<br>
(You can also mention: Rectangle → Process, Diamond → Decision)

5. What are keywords in C?<br>
Keywords are reserved words in C that have special meaning and cannot be used as variable names. Example: int, return.

6. What is a variable in C? <br>
A variable is a named memory location used to store data that can change during program execution.

7. What is meant by symbolic constant?<br>
A symbolic constant is a name that represents a fixed value defined using #define or const, and it cannot be changed during program execution.

8. Name any two features of C language.<br>
• Portability (write once, run anywhere)<br>
• Modularity (programs can be divided into functions)<br>
(You can also write: Fast execution, Rich library, Structured language)
